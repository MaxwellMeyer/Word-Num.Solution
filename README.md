Numbers to Words
Create a console app that translates numbers in numeric form into written words. For example, it would translate 384 into "three hundred eighty four". Use multiple dictionaries to solve this.

Start small, and then get your code working for numbers up to 1 trillion.

Need I remind you to start with your specs and use TDD as you go? Make sure you include a README for this project and create a Git repository for it.

If you get this far, you've done great! Don't worry about getting to the rest of the projects by the end of the day.

dict.1 <int, string> { one, ..., nine }

// something for the ten-19
// ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen

// thirty, forty, fifth
// something for the tens

// ones place thingy + hundred?
// one hundred, two hundred, three hundred

// ones places thingy + thousand?
// one thousand, two thousand
